# Face_Recognition_Engage
#This project is a desktop application that helps in face recognition and uses this feature to take attendance.
#it is based on OpenCV and python and makes use of several libraries like face-recognition, os, date and time, etc.
#This project file has one main part which is the final attendance part which covers all the segments of the project, but for better understanding, I had split the project into two sub-sections, one was face comparison and the other was face recognition.
#The face comparison file mainly works on comparing the given input face with the available set of faces and produces a boolean output along with the detected face.
#The second part (named as the main python file in my project) uses a local webcam and based on the face it displays the frame and details.
#The final part/the summarised part which is the attendance file makes use of both the first and second features and is used as a desktop attendance tracking system.
#It accepts the input of the face from the webcam and if it matches the set of faces in the particular file set, it generated a name and time-oriented excel sheet of the attendance list.
#Thus, this project helps in face recognition, its comparison and is also applied to make an attendance tracking system.
